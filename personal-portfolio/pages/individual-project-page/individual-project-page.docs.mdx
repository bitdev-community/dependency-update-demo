import { Routes, MemoryRouter, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import { IndividualProjectPage } from "./individual-project-page";

A page component that renders information about a single project
Use with a `ThemeProvider` to enforce styling.

### Component usage

Since this is a page level component, use it with a router and a theme provider to enforce theming.
It expected `react-router-dom` as there is a hook `useParams` that fetched the id passed from path params to render the object.
Path param = `id`

```js
<Main>
  <MemoryRouter initialEntries={[{ pathname: "/projects/1" }]} initialIndex={0}>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/projects/:id" element={<IndividualProjectPage />} />
    </Routes>
  </MemoryRouter>
</Main>
```

### Render project page by ID

```js live
<MemoryRouter initialEntries={[{ pathname: "/projects/1" }]} initialIndex={0}>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/projects/:id" element={<IndividualProjectPage />} />
  </Routes>
</MemoryRouter>
```
